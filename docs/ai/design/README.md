# Design Phase

This directory stores the **Technical Blueprint** of the solution.

## Purpose
- Define **How** the feature will be architected.
- Store Technical Design Documents (TDDs), data models, and API contracts.

## Workflow
1.  **Analyze Requirements**: Read the active docs in `../requirements/`.
2.  **Architect**: Propose component structures, interfaces, and algorithms.
3.  **Transition**: Once the blueprint is ready, move to the **Planning** phase.
