# Implementation Phase

This directory stores the **Build Record** and ongoing notes.

## Purpose
- Document the actual coding process.
- Store changelogs, implementation notes, and "won't fix" decisions.

## Workflow
1.  **Execute**: Write code in `packages/` based on the plan.
2.  **Log**: Update implementation docs with significant decisions or deviations.
3.  **Transition**: Once code is feature-complete, move to the **Testing** phase.
