## Purpose

- Store test plans, manual QA checklists, and automated test reports.

## Workflow
1.  **Verify**: Run the verification steps defined in the plan.
2.  **Record**: Document the results (Pass/Fail) and any bugs found.
3.  **Release**: If all tests pass, the feature is ready for deployment.
