# Planning Phase

This directory stores the **Execution Strategy** and granular tasks.

## Purpose
- Break down the *Design* into actionable steps.
- Store `plan.json` files and checklists (`task.md`).

## Workflow
1.  **Break Down**: Convert design components into small, workable units.
2.  **Order**: Determine dependencies and sequence.
3.  **Transition**: Once the plan is set, move to the **Implementation** phase.
