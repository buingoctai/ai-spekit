Ensure docs are readable, accurate, and helpful.

## Step 1: Audit

- **Check**: Are docs stale? Are links broken?

## Step 2: Clarity Edit
- **Refine**: Simplify complex sentences. Remove jargon where possible.
- **Format**: Ensure consistent headers and markdown usage.

## Step 3: Completeness
- **Gap Analysis**: Is anything obvious missing?
- **Action**: Flag gaps or fill them if known.

## Step 4: Publish
- **Action**: Commit changes.

## Step 5: Session Summary
- **Output**: List of docs detailed.
